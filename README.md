A challenge I encountered while creating this submission was creating the timer. 
I dealt this challenge through several ways. 
First, I drew out the process so I had a visual for how my variables linked together and how to proceed with coding. 
Then, I created multiple iterations of my idea. Each time I ran into a problem, I attempted to figure out which aspect of the code was causing it to fail but ultimateluy decided to begin anew. This was more helpful for me since I was able to go through the whole process again and thinking through it allowed me to catch errors that I may have overlooked in previous iterations. 
I also tried coding in a different language. However, this did not help in solving this challenge since the main problem I was running into was figuring out how/when to call setInterval(). 

In the end, I was able to overcome the challenge by reading the documentation of setInterval() and looking at examples for how it worked. I also realized that if I used a boolean to trigger setInterval() then the timer would work as I imagined.
